<p>So, we all have some behavior</p>
<p>that we would like to change about ourselves.</p>
<p>And we certainly all want to help someone else</p>
<p>change their behavior in a positive way.</p>
<p>So, maybe it’s your kid, your spouse, your colleague.</p>
<p>So I want to share some new research with you</p>
<p>that I think reveals something really important</p>
<p>about what gets people to change their behavior.</p>
<p>But before I do that, let’s zoom in on one strategy</p>
<p>that I think you probably use a lot.</p>
<p>So, let’s say you’re trying to stop yourself from snacking.</p>
<p>What do you tell yourself?</p>
<p>Well, most people, in a monologue, will say,</p>
<p>“Beware. You’ll be fat.”</p>
<p>And if this was your kid,</p>
<p>you would probably tell him that smoking kills</p>
<p>and, by the way, he’s in big, big trouble.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>So, what we’re trying to do here</p>
<p>is we’re trying to scare ourselves and others</p>
<p>into changing their behavior.</p>
<p>And it’s not just us.</p>
<p>Warnings and threats are really common in health campaigns, in policy.</p>
<p>It’s because we all share this deep-rooted belief</p>
<p>that if you threaten people, if fear is induced,</p>
<p>it will get them to act.</p>
<p>And it seems like a really reasonable assumption,</p>
<p>except for the fact that the science shows</p>
<p>that warnings have very limited impact on behavior.</p>
<p>So, graphic images on cigarette packets, for example,</p>
<p>do not deter smokers from smoking,</p>
<p>and one study found that, after looking at those images,</p>
<p>quitting actually became a lower priority for smokers.</p>
<p>So, I’m not saying that warnings and threats never work,</p>
<p>but what I’m saying is, on average, they seem to have a very limited impact.</p>
<p>And so, the question is: why?</p>
<p>Why are we resistant to warnings?</p>
<p>Well, if you think about animals,</p>
<p>when you induce fear in an animal,</p>
<p>the most common response you will see is freezing or fleeing;</p>
<p>fighting, not as much.</p>
<p>And so, humans are the same.</p>
<p>So if something scares us,</p>
<p>we tend to shut down and we try to eliminate the negative feelings.</p>
<p>So, we might use rationalizations.</p>
<p>For example, you might tell yourself:</p>
<p>“My grandpa smoked. He lived to be 90.</p>
<p>So, I have really good genes and absolutely nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>And this process can actually make you feel more resilient</p>
<p>than you did before,</p>
<p>which is why warnings sometimes have this boomerang effect.</p>
<p>In other times, we simply put our head in the ground.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>Take the stock market for example.</p>
<p>Do you know when people pull their head out of the ground</p>
<p>to look at their accounts –</p>
<p>not to make a transaction, just to log in to check their account?</p>
<p>So, what you’re seeing here, in black,</p>
<p>is the S&amp;P 500 over two years,</p>
<p>and in gray, is the number of times</p>
<p>that people logged in to their account just to check.</p>
<p>And this is data from Karlsson, Loewenstein &amp; Seppi,</p>
<p>it’s control [data] for all the obvious confounds.</p>
<p>So, what do we see?</p>
<p>When the market is high, people log in all the time,</p>
<p>because positive information makes you feel good,</p>
<p>so you seek it out.</p>
<p>And when the market is low,</p>
<p>people avoid logging in,</p>
<p>because negative information makes us feel bad,</p>
<p>so we try to avoid it altogether.</p>
<p>And all this is true</p>
<p>as long as bad information can reasonably be avoided.</p>
<p>So, what you don’t see here is what happened a few months later,</p>
<p>in the financial collapse of 2008,</p>
<p>when the market went drastically down</p>
<p>and that was when people started logging in frantically,</p>
<p>but it was a bit too late.</p>
<p>So, you can think about it like this – it’s not just finance:</p>
<p>In many different parts of our life,</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>we have warning signs and bad behaviors now.</p>
<p>And they could potentially lead to all these bad outcomes later,</p>
<p>but not necessarily so,</p>
<p>because there are different routs from your present to your future, right?</p>
<p>It can go this way, it can go that way.</p>
<p>And, as time passes,</p>
<p>you gather more and more information about where the wind is blowing.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>And, at any point, you can intervene</p>
<p>and you could potentially change the outcome,</p>
<p>but that takes energy and you might tell yourself:</p>
<p>“What’s the point about worrying about something that might happen?</p>
<p>It might not happen.”</p>
<p>Until we reach this point,</p>
<p>at which time you do jump into action, but sometimes it’s a little bit too late.</p>
<p>So, we wanted to know, in my lab,</p>
<p>what type of information does leak into people.</p>
<p>So, we conducted an experiment</p>
<p>where we asked approximately 100 people to estimate the likelihood</p>
<p>of 80 different negative events that might happen to them in the future.</p>
<p>So, for example, I might ask you:</p>
<p>“What is the likelihood that you’ll suffer hearing loss in your future?”</p>
<p>And let’s say you think it’s about 50%.</p>
<p>Then, I give you the opinion of two different experts.</p>
<p>So, expert A tells you:</p>
<p>“You know, for someone like you, I think it’s only 40%.”</p>
<p>So, they give you a rosier view of your future.</p>
<p>Expert B says:</p>
<p>“You know, for someone like you,</p>
<p>I actually think it’s about 60%. It’s worse.”</p>
<p>So, they give you a bleaker view of your future.</p>
<p>What should you do?</p>
<p>Well, you shouldn’t change your beliefs, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>What we find is that people tend to change their beliefs</p>
<p>towards a more desirable opinion.</p>
<p>In other words, people listen to the positive information.</p>
<p>Now, this study was conducted on college students, so you might say:</p>
<p>“Well, college students are delusional, right? We all know that.”</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>And surely, as we grow older, we grow wiser.</p>
<p>So we said: “OK, let’s test that. Does this really generalize?</p>
<p>Does it generalize to your kid, to your parent?</p>
<p>Does it generalize to your spouse?”</p>
<p>And so, we tested people from the age of 10 until the age of 80,</p>
<p>and the answer was yes.</p>
<p>In all these age groups,</p>
<p>people take in information they want to hear</p>
<p>– like someone telling you you’re more attractive than you thought –</p>
<p>than information that they don’t want to hear.</p>
<p>And the ability to learn from good news</p>
<p>remained quite stable throughout the life span,</p>
<p>but the ability to learn from bad news,</p>
<p>that changes as you age.</p>
<p>So, what we found was that kids and teenagers</p>
<p>were the worse at learning from bad news,</p>
<p>and the ability became better and better as people aged.</p>
<p>But then, around the age of 40, around midlife,</p>
<p>it started deteriorating again.</p>
<p>So, what this means is that the most vulnerable populations,</p>
<p>kids and teenagers on the one hand, and the elderly on the other hand,</p>
<p>they’re the least likely to accurately learn from warnings.</p>
<p>But what you can see here</p>
<p>is that it doesn’t matter what age you are.</p>
<p>You can be 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60;</p>
<p>everyone takes in information they want to hear</p>
<p>more than information that they don’t.</p>
<p>And so, we end up with a view like this of ourselves.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>Our mistake as teachers, as mentors, as employers</p>
<p>is that, instead of working with this positive image</p>
<p>that people so effortfully maintain,</p>
<p>we try and put a clear mirror in front of them.</p>
<p>We tell them: “You know,</p>
<p>the image is just going to get worse and worse and worse.”</p>
<p>And it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work because the brain will frantically try to distort the image,</p>
<p>using Photoshop and fancy lenses,</p>
<p>until it gets the image it’s happy with.</p>
<p>But what would happen if we went along with how our brain works</p>
<p>and not against it?</p>
<p>Take handwashing, for example.</p>
<p>We all know that handwashing is the number one way</p>
<p>to prevent the spread of disease,</p>
<p>and this is really important in hospitals.</p>
<p>So, in a hospital here in the United States,</p>
<p>a camera was installed</p>
<p>to see how often medical staff do, in fact, sanitize their hands</p>
<p>before and after entering a patient’s room.</p>
<p>Now, the medical staff knew a camera was installed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, only one in ten washed their hands</p>
<p>before and after entering a patient’s room.</p>
<p>But then, an intervention was introduced:</p>
<p>an electronic board</p>
<p>that told the medical staff how well they were doing.</p>
<p>Every time you washed your hands, the numbers went up on the screen</p>
<p>and it showed you your rate of your current shift</p>
<p>and the rate of the weekly staff.</p>
<p>And what happened? Boom.</p>
<p>Compliance raised to 90%,</p>
<p>which is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>And the research staff were amazed as well,</p>
<p>and they made sure to replicate it in another division in the hospital.</p>
<p>Again, the same results.</p>
<p>So, why does this intervention work so well?</p>
<p>It works well</p>
<p>because, instead of using warnings</p>
<p>about bad things that can happen in the future, like disease,</p>
<p>it uses three principles that we know really drive your mind and your behavior.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The first one is social incentives.</p>
<p>In the hospital study,</p>
<p>the medical staff could see what other people were doing.</p>
<p>They can see the rates of the shift, the rate of the week.</p>
<p>We’re social people, we really care what other people are doing,</p>
<p>we want to do the same and we want to do it better.</p>
<p>This is an image from a study that we conducted,</p>
<p>led by PhD student Micah Edelson,</p>
<p>and what it’s showing you is a signal in the emotional center of your brain</p>
<p>when you hear about the opinion of others.</p>
<p>And what we found was that this signal can predict</p>
<p>how likely you are to conform at a later time,</p>
<p>how likely you are to change your behavior.</p>
<p>So, the British government are using this principle</p>
<p>to get people to pay taxes on time.</p>
<p>In an old letter that they sent to people who “forgot” to pay taxes on time,</p>
<p>they simply stressed how important it was pay taxes,</p>
<p>and that didn’t help.</p>
<p>Then, they added one sentence,</p>
<p>and that sentence said:</p>
<p>“Nine out of ten people in Britain pay their taxes on time.”</p>
<p>And that one sentence enhanced compliance within that group by 15%,</p>
<p>and it’s thought to bring into the British government</p>
<p>5.6 billion pounds.</p>
<p>So, highlighting what other people are doing is a really strong incentive.</p>
<p>The other principle is immediate rewards.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>every time the staff washed their hand,</p>
<p>they could see the numbers go up on the board and it made them feel good.</p>
<p>And knowing that in advance made them do something</p>
<p>that they, otherwise, may not want to do.</p>
<p>Now, this works because we value immediate rewards,</p>
<p>rewards that we can get now,</p>
<p>more than rewards that we can get in the future.</p>
<p>And people tend to think it’s because we don’t care about the future,</p>
<p>but that’s completely wrong, we all care about our future, right?</p>
<p>We want to be happy and healthy in the future, we want to be successful,</p>
<p>but the future is so far away.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you’ll behave badly now and you’ll be fine in the future,</p>
<p>and maybe you’ll be altogether dead.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>So, the here-and-now you would rather have that tangible drink,</p>
<p>that tangible T-bone,</p>
<p>rather than something that’s uncertain in the future.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it’s not altogether irrational, right?</p>
<p>You’re choosing something sure now</p>
<p>rather than something that is unsure in the future.</p>
<p>But what will happen if you reward people now</p>
<p>for doing actions that are good for them in the future?</p>
<p>Studies show that giving people immediate rewards</p>
<p>make them more likely to quit smoking,</p>
<p>more likely to start exercising,</p>
<p>and this effect lasts for at least six months,</p>
<p>because not smoking becomes associated with a reward,</p>
<p>and exercising becomes associated with a reward,</p>
<p>and it becomes a habit,</p>
<p>it becomes a lifestyle.</p>
<p>So, we can reward ourselves and others now</p>
<p>for behaving in ways that are good for us in the future</p>
<p>and that’s a way for us to bridge the temporal gap.</p>
<p>And the third principle is progress monitoring.</p>
<p>So, the electronic board focused the medical staff attention</p>
<p>on improving their performance.</p>
<p>This is an image from a study that we conducted,</p>
<p>that shows you brain activity</p>
<p>suggestive of efficient coding of positive information about the future.</p>
<p>And what we found was that the brain does a really good job at this,</p>
<p>but it doesn’t do such a good job</p>
<p>at processing negative information about the future.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean?</p>
<p>It means that, if you’re trying to get people’s attention,</p>
<p>you might want to highlight the progress, not the decline.</p>
<p>So, for example,</p>
<p>if you take that kid with the cigarette,</p>
<p>you might want to tell them:</p>
<p>“You know, if you stop smoking, you’ll become better at sports.”</p>
<p>Highlight the progress, not the decline.</p>
<p>Now, before I sum up, let me just share this small anecdote with you.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I got home and I found this bill on my fridge.</p>
<p>And was really surprised because there’s never any bills on my fridge.</p>
<p>So, I was wondering why my husband decided to put that on our fridge.</p>
<p>And so, looking at the bill, I could see that what this bill was trying to do</p>
<p>is get me to be more efficient with my electricity use.</p>
<p>And how was it doing it?</p>
<p>Social incentives, immediate rewards and progress monitoring.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Here are the social incentives.</p>
<p>In gray is the energy use</p>
<p>on the average energy use of people in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>And in blue is my energy use,</p>
<p>and in green is the most efficient neighbor.</p>
<p>And my reaction to this was –</p>
<p>my immediate reaction was:</p>
<p>“I’m a little bit better than average” (Laughter)</p>
<p>– a tiny bit, but still…</p>
<p>and my husband had exactly the same reaction –</p>
<p>and “I want to get to the green bar.”</p>
<p>And then, I got a smiley face.</p>
<p>That was my immediate reward and it was telling me, “You’re doing good,”</p>
<p>and it made me want to put this on my fridge.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>And although I have this one smiley face,</p>
<p>I can see an opportunity there to get two smiley faces.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>So, there’s an opportunity for progress</p>
<p>and it’s showing me my progress throughout the year,</p>
<p>how my energy use changes throughout the year.</p>
<p>And the last thing this bill gave me:</p>
<p>it gave me a sense of control.</p>
<p>So, it gave me a sense of I was in control of my use of electricity.</p>
<p>And that is a really important thing,</p>
<p>if you try to get people to change their behavior,</p>
<p>because the brain is constantly trying to seek ways to control its environment.</p>
<p>It’s one of the principles of what the brain is actually doing.</p>
<p>And so, giving people a sense of control is a really important motivator.</p>
<p>OK. So, what am I not saying?</p>
<p>I’m not saying that we do not need to communicate risks,</p>
<p>and I’m not saying that there’s one-solution-fits-all,</p>
<p>but I am saying that, if we want to motivate change,</p>
<p>we might want to rethink how we do it,</p>
<p>because fear, the fear of losing your health, the fear of losing money,</p>
<p>induces inaction,</p>
<p>while the thrill of a gain induces action.</p>
<p>And so, to change behavior in ourselves and in others,</p>
<p>we may want to try these positive strategies</p>
<p>rather than threats,</p>
<p>which really capitalize on the human tendency</p>
<p>to seek progress.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
